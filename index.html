                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    Morgott was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg. 
                    The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital. 
                    Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised. Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a blade, which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.
