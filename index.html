                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    Morgott was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg. 
                    The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital. 
                    Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised. Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a blade, which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.

                <h1>The Shattering</h1>
                <p>
                    When Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott swore to protect the Erdtree.

                <p>
                    He assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord. Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions. Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After claiming two shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, holding Morgott's body as it fades away.
