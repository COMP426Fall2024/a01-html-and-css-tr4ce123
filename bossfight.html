            <h2>About the fight</h2>
            <h3>Phase 1</h3>
            <p>"Morgott is a highly aggressive and fast-moving enemy, chaining together attacks in rapid succession while leaving few openings. His curved sword inflicts blood loss on impact, while the holy armaments he summons deal holy damage. He has ranged attacks, such as his throwing knives and spear, and utilises jumps, cartwheels, and dashes to close or create distance."</p>
            <h3>Phase 2</h3>
            <p>"Once his health drops to 50%, Morgott performs an area of effect attack in which his cursed blood erupts from the ground. His blade becomes infused with his cursed blood, and he gains a number of bloodflame-based attacks. He may also summon golden blades that rain down from the sky."</p>
            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>"The arena is a wide, circular platform with no obstacles, aside from the throne which will break if hit."</p>
